# Real-Time-data-analysis
🔌 Project Title: Real-Time Energy Consumption Data Analysis using MATLAB and Arduino  I'm excited to share a recent project focused on real-time energy monitoring using MATLAB and Arduino!
📊 In this project, I developed a real-time data logging system that captures energy consumption data every second using simulated sensor values. The system uses:

MATLAB for scripting and data processing

Arduino for simulating energy data

JSON format for storing time-stamped energy readings

📁 Key Features:

Records timestamped power data (in watts) with 1-second intervals

Generates and saves the data into a JSON file dynamically

Displays the structured data in a web-friendly table format

This project enhances the real-time monitoring of power consumption and lays the foundation for integrating real sensors for live IoT applications.

💡 Tools Used:
MATLAB | Arduino | JSON | HTML | Web Data Display

Proud to be progressing on my journey into energy analytics and embedded systems. 🚀
